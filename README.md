# KT Tools for Prism OS

This is a repository for Prism OSes KT tools which is primarily for open source development of drivers for the 64bit operating system
We will graciously accept driver dumps for a variety of hardware but do not post drivers before 2006 or for hardware before 2006 as legacy support will be limited to hardware after 2006 and no legacy support for hardware from before then and so on.

Please supply 64bit drivers only and must be a dump or not compiled aka just readable code that can be ported to work with my compiler and kernel.

Only linux drivers because windows drivers are a pain in the butt to convert over.
